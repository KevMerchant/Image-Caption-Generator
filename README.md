# Image-Caption-Generator

This project is based on Image captioning using Tensorflow Keras and deploying it on a simple webapp. 
In order to run this file, you will have to download the code to your system:
1. run the jupyter notebook file first. It will take some time as the model requires high power hardware. 
2. Once you have the model weights, run the FinalImagePred.py file. app.py file is yor flask backend and index is basically your html web app. 
3. Open cmd and navigate to your directory, run app.py. open your browser, run localhost and voila!
